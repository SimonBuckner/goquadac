# Quick and Dirty API Client

A collection of tools I use when querying API's for personal use. This is very 
much a work in progress and should be used with caution.

## How to Use

To install use.

```
go get -u github.com/simonbuckner/goquadac
```

For an example of how to build a client with this library, use this project.

  - [github.com/simonbuckner/axcient](https://github.com/simonbuckner/axcient/)

## Used in these projects

### Axcient x360Recover API

  - Project       : [Client for the Axcient x360Recover API](https://github.com/simonbuckner/axcient)
  - Product Page  : [Axcient x360Recover](https://axcient.com/products/x360recover/)
  - API Reference : [Axcient x360Recover API reference](https://developer.axcient.com/x360recover/)

## Outstanding Tasks

These are things I'd like to implement, time permitting. Some will come out of 
necessity as I query additional APIs.
  
- Write some unit and integration tests
- Write some documentation
- Better coverage of HTTP methods
- Support for other authentication methods
